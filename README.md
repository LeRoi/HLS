# HLS
A collection of scripts I use to make law school a bit easier.

new_case.py - creates templated case briefs.  
food_scraper.py - scrape HLS event calendar for free food.  
food_server.py - serve food_scraper.py to localhost.  

food_server.py can be exposed by something like ngrok, or just hosted on your own webserver.
